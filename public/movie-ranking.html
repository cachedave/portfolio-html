<h1>The Best Movies According to Avery</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of 2024</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Singing in the Rain</h3>
<p>Each actor provides show-stopping, stunning performances in this film. From the set design, music, dancing, and plot, they simply do not make films like this anymore!</p>
<h3>T&aacute;r</h3>
<p>Cate Blanchett creates a real, living and breathing universe that is Lydia T&aacute;r. This dramatic, nearly psychological thriller offers up stimulating discourse
    regarding cancel culture, ambition, and double standards in girl-boss ideaologies. 
</p>
<h3>Downtown 81</h3>
<p>This film is a gem of '80s NYC subculture. Starring Jean-Michel Basquiat, this movie offers an inside look into the No Wave music scene through Basquiat's lens. 
    Bands like Liquid Liquid, Suicide, Plastics, DNA, and Kid Creole and the Coconuts can be seen and heard in this cult-classic.
