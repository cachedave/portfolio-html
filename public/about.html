<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my web development portfolio website. I am an artist learning web development through 
  Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. I am passionate about travelling, language-learning, reading, hot yoga, and music. 
  I am working on an album for my project Avery Island BCE and play bass in STEEF, Action Lady, and Butte. I hope to learn solid 
  foundations of a variety of programming languages in order to create websites for personal projects, friends, family members, and one day,
  clients! I have a B.S. in Marketing with a concentration in Data Analytics and minor in Art History from Louisiana State University. I have 
  over seven years of hospitality and customer service experience; four years of experience as a musician including work as a stagehand 
  and sound engineer; and I currently work for the New Orleans Public Library. I've also taught ESL, worked in art galleries, museums,
  and been a caretaker. I currently live in New Orleans with two cats, Mangus and Jax.
